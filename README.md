as of Mar 5- 2025 
- finished and finalized the project 
took reference from other finished projects 
    - for the last part (cannot understand loops and how to return values to default).
    - for score (finished this part but added and discarded codes based on reference).

Will get back to the game to add some elements when I finish T.O.P.

    I added A user interface playing the game.
    code not yet complete
    some bugs like final score of 5 does not show up
    I want to display what is happening like the actual game happening
    I will add more code and clean the code when I learn More.
